# odin-recipes
The goal of this project is to build a recipe webpage.
I will create html layouts employing heads and metadata, body elelements and stylistic elements like stong and emphasis. I will use anchor elements to create links to other pages thoughout the directory. The project will use img elements to display images. This project will also demonstrate usage of Git and Github repository systems to create full progress back ups.
This is my first website.
